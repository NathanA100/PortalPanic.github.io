            <p>Thinking the jagged opening to look somewhat precarious given the circumstances, you decide to stick your arm through the wavy opening. The moment your finger enters the light, you’re suddenly yanked entirely through, and the unfortunate fact that you are not very big ends up being your choice. </p>
            <p>You flow through light, being shot through something you would only describe as a wormhole. You have no real point of reference for this, but sci-fi movies illustrate this way better than you would. Eventually, though, you are dropped somewhere. You land with a thud, rubbing your head due to the immense pressure of being thrown through space giving you a headache.</p>
            <p>You’re now surrounded by a group of pirate lackeys! Well, this is certainly unfortunate. At least you aren’t sea sick!</p>
            <p>All of these henchmen are staring at you, some of them holding their cutlasses at their side as if expecting you to attack. Fortunately, you can deduce that being an adult would have immediately gotten you killed and that the only reason they haven’t killed you already is because you are a  kid.</p>
            <p>You don’t move an inch, scared to provoke anyone, and you eventually hear the captain walk up behind you. At least, you can assume it’s the captain. The reactions of the henchmen give that away. Nevertheless, you are, as one would say, screwed.</p>
            <p>Or, you thought that. The captain of this ship gives a hearty chuckle standing behind you, before seemingly planting a hat on your head. You are confused. Extremely confused. You have no idea what this means.</p>
