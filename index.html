            <p>You are currently in the confines of your nice room, messing around with a beginners chemistry set that your parents gave you many years ago for your birthday.He said it was cheap, but the enjoyment it has brought you puts a price on it invaluable to any other thing in your life. Except for, possibly, your dads collection of chocolate-covered caramel sweets. </p>
            <p>Today you were a bit bored, however. Chemistry is only so fun without dangerous chemicals to work with and youre old enough to know that your parents would not be keen your making mustard gas to kill the cockroaches in the house. You know this because you tried a week ago and were grounded for it. Nevertheless, you decided to invest your time into something a bit more unique. </p>
            <p>Being a child of science, alchemy was always bogus to you, though the power of boredom has compelled you to look into some online alchemical setups in order to do normal things for alchemy. Youre not looking for something useful, though, so you pick the first recipe that catches your eye. A solution that can turn rubber into stone. Allegedly. </p>
            <p>You started to use your chemistry set to make this concoction already. Everything goes well, but you notice your glass tube at the end thats begun to contain this solution is not being held properly. Surely this will cause problems if you dont fix this, but some lazy part of you beckons.</p>
