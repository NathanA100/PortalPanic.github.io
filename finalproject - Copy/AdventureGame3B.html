            <p> You’ve decided that the most precarious option will obviously be the most interesting one, so you shove your arm right into the jagged light. It seems like you shoved your arm in so hard, though, you’ve thrown your entire body into it. </p>
            <p> Light whips by as you’re pulled to another realm, but it seems like the light dims the longer you are pulled. Darker, darker, darker… until you suddenly are enveloped in complete darkness. Thankfully, though, you feel yourself hit something akin to a ground, giving you some room to move around. </p>
            <p> You stand up, rubbing your head from that slight headache landing suddenly on the ground can give you. You catch a glimpse of your own hands, completely gray. All of your clothes, your whole body, it’s all completely gray. Your scientific mind can’t help but come up with a reason, and the only logical explanation is that you’ve ended up somewhere that color doesn’t exist due to a lack of direct light. The only light you have is, ironically, the darkness. </p>
            <p> You stare at your hands for a moment, confused as to how you’re even here in the first place. What was the concoction? Did you do it wrong? Maybe you found a secret of the universe without realizing it? Regardless of the situation, you can’t help but feel your old fear of the dark creeping up on you. You may have never fully gotten over the fear of the dark, quite honestly. This space is certainly not helping it, that’s for sure. </p>
            <p> Well… it’s just you here. </p>
            <p> You and that thing behind you. </p>
